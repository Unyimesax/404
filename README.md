## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/Unyimesax/404/blob/master/screenshot.png)


This project is an error 404 landing page built only with HTML and CSS. You can view the project in realtime on www.kind-beaver.netlify.app.
Building this project took me a longer time than expected, because it was only when I started working on it, I realized that I didn't know how 
to do things like using git and github from the command line, hosting the project on netlify, responsive designs with media query ...etc. 
It was indeed expository for me because I learnt a lot doing this project: including little things like testing on different screen sizes using
dev tools. I'm excited about jumping on to the next project.
